            Q. How would you ensure a web design is user-friendly?{" "}

          <div className="fs-4 ps-5 pt-2">
            <p>
              For making a web-design user-friendly we have to keep the
              following points in mind:-
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span className="fw-bold">Responsive - </span>
                <p>
                  At present most of the users use mobiles for accessing
                  websites. Hence our website should be mobile friendly so that
                  it can be accessed with mobile without any error in design.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="fw-bold">Easy to navigate - </span>
                <p>
                  Web design should be simple so that users can easily navigate
                  between the pages.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="fw-bold">Color-Scheme - </span>
                <p>
                  It matters a lot to stick the user to our website because if
                  colors are so fancy and irritating no one wants to keep their
                  eyes on a website. Hence color scheme of a website should be
                  planned that it is pleasuring the eyes of the user.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="fw-bold">Fast loading time - </span>
                <p>
                  Website should be fast in response, processing, and displaying
                  output. User doesnâ€™t like websites that are slow, so one
                  should use good web hosting to host a website.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="fw-bold">Free from bugs - </span>
                <p>
                  Website should be good in error handling and has no bugs. It
                  irritates the user if the website is not working properly.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="fw-bold">Site layout and design - </span>
                <p>
                  One should keep the web-design simple and organized. It helps
                  the user to easily search and go through the website for the
                  purpose they come.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
